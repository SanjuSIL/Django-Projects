I want you help in making an HTML responsive page. I hope you can help me on this. I will give you the details of my requirements. Please ask me the questions if you have so that I can provide the answers for the same before you provide me the html page and the source code of the same.

I want a page to look like a Chat Window with multiple vertical divisions divided by differential layers. From the Top, I want a Header layer to have the Company Name and Logo which can cover about 12.5% of the total area. Then I want the second layer of about 27.5% area to have a Scrolling Image Tiles which will have about 3 or 4 or 5 image tiles horizontally scrolling in the area. The Third layer is area for the Chat Responses received from the server which can be about 35% of the area. The Forth layer is the Chat Request Area which will be 20% of the area with a Send Button on the Right side. Inside this Chat Request Area, there should be Pre Defined 3 or 4 Buttons covering area after leaving the Users to type Text. Inside the button, there shall be Texts "Order Status", "Menu", "Help", "Rating". These Buttons shall be in Horizontal Scrolling model. The Balance 5% shall be the last Layer with the Product name or the branding area to have a text or image. I also want a back ground to have the name of the product in Watermark.

As soon as the page is loaded, I want the Page to ask me Permission in a Nice way requesting me to grand Permission to Play Sound, Bring Notification, bring Vibration when the Browser is in Sleep Mode or in Open mode. I want the Coding to have the Permission handling in the way as required. 

In the Chat Response Window, I want the Text " Hi, Good Way, Welcome!" In the First Line and in the Next Line " Kindly Enter the Bill Number and Send so that we can Track your Order".

The Functionality of the Page shall be to get loaded when the user enter the URL and the page should as the Permissions for Vibration, use Audio, Notification and other relevant Permissions. Once the page loads, there should be default Voice message that says "Hi, Welcome, Good Day. Could you please enter the Bill Number and Send so that I can Search the Order Status". There shall be provision for a Pop Up asking the Customer to disable further notifications. In case the Person press the Disable, no further notification should come, else every 1 Minute the Welcome Message sound and Request to enter the Bill Number should be played.     

Further, I want the area to add the API so that the API with the Entered Bill number can be send and the Response Received can be Displayed. The Responses will be  "Processing" and then "Ready". Once the Response Ready is received, the Sound "Your Order is Ready" with a Ding Dong Sound shall be played along with Vibration. There shall be provision for a Pop Up asking the Customer to disable further notifications. In case the Person press the Disable, no further notification should come, else every 1 Minute the Order Ready Status Sound and the Ding Dong sound should be played.

You can use the Nice Looking Pop Up.
